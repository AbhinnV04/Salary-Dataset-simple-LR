# Salary-Dataset-simple-LR
This is my first End-to-End Data Science/ML project. <br>
I used a simple single-feature dataset for implementing Linear Regression using both the scikit-learn's and a Linear Regression model ***I built from scratch using Gradient Descent***. <br>
The Model is deployed on ***Streamlit Community cloud*** <br>
